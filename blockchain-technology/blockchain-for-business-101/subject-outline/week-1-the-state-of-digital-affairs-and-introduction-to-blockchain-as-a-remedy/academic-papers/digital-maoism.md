In a world progressively dominated by digital interactions and technologies, understanding the dynamics and implications of online collectivism is becoming increasingly crucial. This is especially true in fields such as business computing and blockchain, where decentralization and distributed systems take center stage. Jaron Lanier's "Digital Maoism: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism," presents a critique of online collectivism that is both insightful and provocative, making it an essential part of an Introduction to Business Computing and Blockchain course.

"Digital Maoism" presents the inherent dangers of an unchecked belief in the wisdom of online crowds or digital collectives. Lanier warns of a new online collectivism, where the aggregation of individual inputs leads to an authoritative, often anonymous, collective voice that overshadows the value of individual expertise and judgment. This perspective is crucial in understanding the pitfalls of assuming that a blockchain, or any other distributed system, will automatically lead to better outcomes simply due to its decentralized nature.

Students studying business computing are often introduced to the revolutionary potential of blockchain technology. It is viewed as a harbinger of decentralization, promising to dismantle the hegemony of centralized authorities in various sectors, from finance to supply chain to data management. However, as Lanier's essay suggests, the shift from centralization to decentralization is not without its risks.

Studying "Digital Maoism" equips students with the critical thinking necessary to navigate these risks. They learn that while blockchain's decentralization could democratize control and participation, there is a flip side to this coin. Too much emphasis on collective decisions might devalue expert opinions and lead to 'groupthink', which can be counterproductive and even dangerous.

For instance, consider a public blockchain where decisions about modifications to the blockchain protocol are made based on the majority of miners' votes. This majority rule approach might seem like a democratic process on the surface. However, if the crowd gets swayed by short-term benefits, they could endorse changes that might harm the blockchain's long-term integrity. This scenario underscores the importance of expert involvement in crucial decisions, an aspect that might get sidelined in a purely collectivist approach.

Lanier's essay also warns about the potential loss of individual credit and acknowledgment in a digital collective. In a blockchain context, this notion is linked to the concept of digital identity and data ownership. Blockchain has the potential to allow individuals to control their digital identities and the data they generate. However, if not appropriately managed, the collective nature of blockchain might lead to data aggregation and anonymization, posing challenges to individual data ownership and attribution.

Furthermore, "Digital Maoism" prompts students to think about the potential manipulation of online collectives. In a blockchain context, this could relate to the so-called '51% attacks' or other forms of manipulation by those who control a significant portion of the network. An understanding of these hazards is necessary to design more secure and resilient blockchains.

Finally, Lanier's essay prompts a reconsideration of the human-machine interface. Blockchain and smart contracts promise automation and disintermediation, but the human element must not be ignored. There is a need for human judgment, expertise, and intervention in critical areas, something that a naive endorsement of total decentralization might overlook.

In conclusion, including "Digital Maoism: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism" in an introductory course on business computing and blockchain technology offers invaluable insights into the potential hazards of online collectivism. It encourages students to approach decentralization and digital collectivism critically, considering not only their advantages but also the potential pitfalls.

By studying this piece, students gain a more nuanced understanding of the balance between decentralization and centralization, collective wisdom and individual expertise, and automation and human judgment. They learn that while blockchain technology has transformative potential, its effective and responsible application requires a comprehensive understanding of its societal implications. Lanier's essay provides an essential perspective for developing this understanding.
