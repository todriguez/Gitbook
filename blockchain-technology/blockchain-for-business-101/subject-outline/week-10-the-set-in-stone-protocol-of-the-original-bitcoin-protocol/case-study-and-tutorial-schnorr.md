# Case Study & Tutorial - Schnorr

[https://craigwright.net/blog/bitcoin-blockchain-tech/schnorr/](https://craigwright.net/blog/bitcoin-blockchain-tech/schnorr/)

The article discusses the implications of protocol variations on the legal standing of a blockchain, specifically Bitcoin. It emphasizes the difference between privacy and anonymity, arguing that Bitcoin was designed to be a private but not anonymous system. The author argues that anonymous systems are not legally enforceable and are prone to misuse, as seen in the Silk Road case. The article also discusses the introduction of Schnorr signatures, which some believe can provide plausible deniability and additional anonymity. However, the author argues that this is a misunderstanding and that such changes could lead to legal issues, including violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. The article concludes by stating that Bitcoin's protocol should remain immutable and that attempts to alter it for anonymity purposes will only lead to legal complications and potential failure.

Leading Questions:

1. What is the difference between privacy and anonymity in the context of blockchain technology, and why is this distinction important?
2. How can changes to Bitcoin's protocol, such as the introduction of Schnorr signatures, potentially lead to legal issues?
3. What is the Bank Secrecy Act, and how could protocol variations potentially violate this act?
4. Why is it important for Bitcoin's protocol to remain immutable, and what are the potential consequences of altering it?
5. How does the author view the attempts to alter Bitcoin's protocol for anonymity purposes, and why?
6. What are the implications of these protocol changes for businesses that rely on Bitcoin's blockchain?
7. How does the author's perspective align or contrast with the principles discussed in Week 10 - The 'Set-in-Stone' Protocol of the Original Bitcoin Protocol?
8. How can understanding the Original Bitcoin Protocol and its immutability help businesses navigate the legal landscape of blockchain technology?
