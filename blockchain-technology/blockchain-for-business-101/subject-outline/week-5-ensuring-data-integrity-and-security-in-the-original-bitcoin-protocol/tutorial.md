1. Explain the concept of immutability in the context of a blockchain. Why is this feature critical for data security and integrity?
2. Describe the proof-of-work process in the Original Bitcoin Protocol. What role does it play in maintaining the immutability of the blockchain?
3. How does the proof-of-work mechanism contribute to the overall security of the Original Bitcoin Protocol?
4. Can you provide a real-world scenario where the immutability of a blockchain could be beneficial for a business?
5. What are the potential challenges or drawbacks associated with the proof-of-work mechanism in the Original Bitcoin Protocol?
6. Explain what a Merkle Tree is and describe its function in the Original Bitcoin Protocol.
7. How do Merkle Trees contribute to the efficiency of handling large datasets in the context of blockchain technology?
8. Discuss the concept of selective disclosure in Merkle Trees. How does this feature enhance privacy while still demonstrating data integrity?
9. Imagine you have a large dataset that you wish to securely and efficiently store on a blockchain. How would you use Merkle Trees to achieve this?
10. Reflect on the "Verifiable LiDAR Data" case. How were Merkle Trees utilized for efficient data handling and creating a verifiable audit trail?
11. Discuss the potential applicability of Merkle Trees in an industry of your choice. What benefits and challenges could arise from its implementation?
12. How could the concept of data integrity and security, as provided by the Original Bitcoin Protocol, impact future business operations?
13. What measures could be taken to further enhance the data security and integrity features of the Original Bitcoin Protocol?
14. How does the proof-of-work process help prevent double-spending within the Original Bitcoin Protocol?
15. Explain how the blockchain technology can redefine trust and the value of data based on the Predict Ecology example.
