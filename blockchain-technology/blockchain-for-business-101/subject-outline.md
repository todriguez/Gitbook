**Course Title:** Business Applications of the Original Bitcoin Protocol: A Foundation Course

**Subject Description:** This 12-week foundational course aims to explore the transformative potential of the Original Bitcoin Protocol (OBP) for contemporary business processes. The course introduces students to the core principles of OBP, contrasting it with other blockchain technologies, and showcases its unique business applications. Utilizing real-world case studies, the course delves into how OBP can be utilized to enhance various business processes such as digital transactions, supply chain management, data management, regulatory compliance, large-scale operations, audit processes, B2B and B2C transactions, access management, notarization processes, triple-entry accounting, and EDI and invoicing. Students will develop a critical understanding of OBP and its role in transforming contemporary business landscapes.

**Key Learning Outcomes:** By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the core principles and unique features of the Original Bitcoin Protocol.
2. Differentiate between OBP and other blockchain technologies from a business perspective.
3. Understand the regulatory landscape surrounding blockchain technologies and the compliance features of OBP.

6. Understand the implications of OBP's integration with business processes for society at large.

**Week 1 - The Problem that Satoshi Nakamoto Solved**

* Satoshi Nakamoto invented a check valve for data. Computers are very good at copying data, but very bad at not copying data. The Bitcoin database is uniquely a database that can only be changed forward in time, without a central authority, solving the 'Handshake Problem' at scale.
* The Bitcoin database was created as a peer to peer payment system, but can equally well be thought of as a global distributed computer, with its own coding language, similar to Forth, called Bitcoin Script and data storage within 'blocks' in what Satoshi Nakamoto originally described as a 'block chain'.
* 1.7 billion adults globally, and 66% of the Philippines' population of 109 million (72 million) are without access to a bank account. Bitcoin radically lowers the barrier to entry to financial services, anyone with a smartphone can now send and received money globally. [https://www.unbankedmap.org/](https://www.unbankedmap.org/)
* In addition to this, the value, integrity and provenance of much of the data being collected on the internet is subject to Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection. Jaron Lanier coined the term 'Siren Server' to describe how internet users are not the true business customers of platforms like Facebook, Google and so forth and Tristan Harris at the Institute for Humane Technology describes how data and attention hacking can be weaponised against the interests of users for profit. None of this was planned, but it all results from a lack of ability of the internet to solve the handshake problem for data, to allow users to own their data and support micropayments.

* Introduction to the Original Bitcoin Protocol: Genesis and philosophy. Backdrop of the 2008 financial crisis, a problem of moral hazard and adverse selection in risk markets, also barriers to entry for sharing material risk data and material fact data were very high, thus by the time the appropriate risk markets were made to manage the risk of a housing bubble, it was too late to prevent systemic failure. Bitcoin solves this problem by creating better more transparent markets for data not just directly related to finance, but also directly related to material risk and material facts. This allows society to be able to afford and manage the sunk cost of engineering and, crucially, innovation, which, according to Robert Solow, accounts for 80% of economic growth.

The Bitcoin Genesis block highlighted the backdrop of the problem of moral hazard in financial markets, stemming from artificial barriers to entry and an inability of market participants to deliver material risk and material fact information to be traded appropriately on time.&#x20;
