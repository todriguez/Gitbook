# The application of blockchain technology for supply chain visibility - A case study of the fish farm

{% embed url="https://media.unisot.com/2019/08/Master-thesis-FINAL.pdf" %}

1. The thesis explores the application of blockchain technology for supply chain visibility, specifically in the context of the fish farming industry.
2. The authors identify two major features of blockchain: trust and decentralization, with three sub-characteristics within each. Decentralization means that in a blockchain transaction system, each transaction does not need to be validated through a central trusted agency. This implies that third parties, which result in higher costs and performance bottlenecks at the central servers, are no longer needed.
3. The authors discuss the current situation in the fish farming industry, including the importance of quality, price, and service. They also mention the rise in technological solutions for product tracking in the industry today, such as sensor technologies, RFID, cooling labels, GPS-based systems, track and trace systems, and cameras.
4. The thesis suggests that blockchain technology could potentially change the dynamics of supply chain visibility. One blockchain expert argued for the blockchain implementation in the fish farming industry, stating that there is too little transparency throughout the supply chain and significant complexity and inefficiencies in the industry.
5. The authors also discuss the challenges of implementing blockchain technology in supply chains, including the need for industries to develop standards that allow all systems to speak the same language.
6. The thesis concludes by suggesting that future research should look at how food supply chain visibility will become more important due to pressing demands from customers on sustainability.

Please note that this is a high-level summary and the document contains much more detailed information.
