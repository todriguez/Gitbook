# Week 7 - UNISOT

The case study explores the potential of blockchain technology, specifically the Original Bitcoin Protocol (OBP), to improve supply chain visibility in the fish farming industry. The industry faces challenges related to cost, quality, and sustainability, with an increasing demand for transparency from consumers. The study found that blockchain technology could enhance visibility, improve operational efficiency, and secure the documentation of information. The use of blockchain, combined with other technologies like IoT devices, could automate information capture along the supply chain, which is mostly done manually today. The study also identified barriers to blockchain adoption, including a lack of knowledge and the need for industry-wide participation, regulations, and standards. The authors conclude that the fish farming industry should further explore the potential of blockchain technology, given its potential to revolutionize business operations.
