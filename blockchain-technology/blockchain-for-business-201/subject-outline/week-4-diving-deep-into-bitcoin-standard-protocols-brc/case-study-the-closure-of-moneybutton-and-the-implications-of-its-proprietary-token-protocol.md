# Case Study: The Closure of MoneyButton and the Implications of its Proprietary Token Protocol

[https://coingeek.com/moneybutton-to-shut-down-by-june-26-tells-users-to-move-funds/](https://coingeek.com/moneybutton-to-shut-down-by-june-26-tells-users-to-move-funds/)

The closure of MoneyButton, a popular Bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain wallet application, has significant implications for the blockchain and business landscape. MoneyButton, which had its proprietary token protocol known as Simple Fabriik Protocol (SFP), advised all users to remove assets from their wallets due to its shutdown. This event highlights the importance of standardization in blockchain technology and the potential risks associated with proprietary protocols.

From a business perspective, the closure of MoneyButton underscores the importance of adaptability and the need for businesses to stay abreast of technological advancements. MoneyButton, once a popular BSV wallet due to its novel "swipe-to-pay" slider, was gradually outpaced by other wallets with more popular features. The lack of a MoneyButton mobile app likely stunted its userbase growth as mobile apps like HandCash introduced slick interface upgrades and external app links, and RelayX became a favorite for NFT traders.

The shutdown of MoneyButton also brings to light the risks associated with proprietary protocols. MoneyButton's proprietary token protocol, SFP, was one of many token protocols developed for BSV. With the shutdown of MoneyButton, the future of SFP and the assets associated with it is uncertain. This situation highlights the potential risks of relying on proprietary protocols and the importance of interoperability in blockchain technology.

In relation to the Bitcoin Standard Protocols (BRC) model, the MoneyButton case study serves as a real-world example of the potential pitfalls of not adhering to standard protocols. BRC protocols aim to facilitate interoperability, efficiency, and enhanced security within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The closure of MoneyButton and the uncertainty surrounding its proprietary SFP protocol underscore the importance of these standardization efforts.
