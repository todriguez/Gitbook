# Case Study: UTXO based Ordinals

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZNl7LzUBG5U?feature=share" %}

The video provides key insights into the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin SV (BSV), its technical aspects, potential use cases, and the value it brings to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

**Technical Aspects and Features of Ordinals**

* The Ordinals protocol, created by Casey Rodimore on BTC, allows for the coloring and putting of stuff on tokens, which is considered a super novel technology. üõ†Ô∏è
* The resilience of ordinals comes from relying on an indexer to keep track of the ordinal ID associated with the token, allowing it to be easily sent around. üîÑ
* Native Bitcoin UTXOs allow for the safe sending, receiving, and viewing of tokens, even without fully functional indexers. üì¶
* The combination of interesting merits, accessible libraries, easy-to-understand protocol, and good documentation makes ordinals a protocol that people can easily hop in and build something with. üìö
* The success of BSV is attributed to its accessibility and ease of use, making it a popular choice for creating and indexing tokens. üöÄ
* BTC uses a commit transaction and a reveal transaction with inscription data in the input signatures to store data on the blockchain, instead of directly making an output with data. üìñ
* The big innovation of ordinals is the numbering system, tracing back a Satoshi all the way to its coinbase block and giving it a unique number, which wasn't obvious in other token protocols. üí°

**Potential Use Cases and Impact of Ordinals on BSV**

* Ordinals on BSV offer potential use cases such as cross-chain swaps and the ability to mint a large number of tokens in a single transaction, providing powerful capabilities not available on BTC. üíº
* The use of ordinals on BSV allows for the creation of augmented reality apps that can tag specific geohashes to 3D models, enhancing the user experience. üåê
* The launch process of Ordinals on BSV aims to bring something unique and innovative to the world of Bitcoin, challenging the perception that it's only for "nerds" and showcasing its potential for broader adoption. üöÄ
* The decision to prioritize low inscription numbers for tokens on BSV was driven by user demand and the desire to be considered part of the valid set by indexers and other websites. üìà
* The integration of ordinals with map and other technologies can potentially shape the future of data representation and metadata, allowing for more efficient and composable protocols. üåê
* Bitcoin ordinals have the potential to rebuild the entire internet, integrating with existing infrastructure and allowing for gradual adoption rather than a sudden transition. üåç

**Utility and Value of Ordinals on BSV**

* Ordinals on BSV have utility and value, as they can be used to wrap episodes into an ordinal inscription and blast them off to friends for watching. üéÅ
* The value of the BSV protocol lies in its openness and lack of specific licensing requirements, making it a truly open platform for users. üåê
* The opportunity to unite different groups around a certain thing on BSV is valuable and hadn't happened up to this point, but it looks like it's finally happening. ü§ù
