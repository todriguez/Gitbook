# Week 9: Evolution of Token Standards and Introduction to 1Sat Ordinals Protocol

Lecture Plan:

1. Introduction (5 minutes)
   * Recap of previous lectures and introduction to the week's topic
   * Importance of token standards in the Bitcoin ecosystem
2. Overview of the Evolution of Token Standards in the Bitcoin Ecosystem (15 minutes)
   * Discuss the evolution of token standards, from using op\_return payload to inscribing on single satoshis
   * Discuss the problems and limitations of earlier token standards
   * Discuss the benefits and innovations brought about by the evolution of token standards, including interoperability, protocol stability, and the unification of ideologically divided groups
   * Discuss the issues that arose for token holders from MoneyButton's proprietary token once their service shut down, and how this relates to the evolution of token standards
3. Introduction to the 1Sat Ordinals Protocol (15 minutes)
   * Detailed overview of the 1Sat Ordinals protocol for creating tokens and NFTs
   * Discuss the technical aspects and features of the Ordinals protocol, including the use of an indexer to keep track of the ordinal ID associated with the token and the use of native Bitcoin UTXOs
   * Discuss the potential use cases and impact of the Ordinals protocol, including cross-chain swaps, the creation of augmented reality apps, and the potential to rebuild the entire internet
   * Discuss the utility and value of the Ordinals protocol, including its openness and lack of specific licensing requirements
4. Hands-on Experience with the 1Sat Ordinals Wallet (15 minutes)
   * Walkthrough of the 1Sat Ordinals wallet, including inscribing satoshis with jpegs and creating fungible tokens
   * Discuss the benefits of creating a standard interface for wallets in the Bitcoin SV space, including interoperability and ease of integration
5. Introduction to the Case Study: Real-world Implications of the Evolution of Token Standards and Business Applications of Tokens and NFTs (5 minutes)
   * Provide a brief overview of the case study, which explores the real-world implications of the evolution of token standards and the business applications of tokens and NFTs
   * Assign the detailed analysis of the case study as homework for tutorial preparation
6. Discussion and Q\&A (5 minutes)
   * Open the floor for questions and discussion on the lecture's content
   * Clarify any doubts and provide additional information as needed

Learning Outcomes:

By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:

1. Understand the evolution of token standards in the Bitcoin ecosystem and the benefits and innovations brought about by this evolution
2. Understand the problems and limitations of earlier token standards and how the evolution of token standards addresses these issues
3. Understand the technical aspects, potential use cases, and value of the 1Sat Ordinals protocol
4. Gain hands-on experience with the 1Sat Ordinals wallet and understand the benefits of creating a standard interface for wallets in the Bitcoin SV space
