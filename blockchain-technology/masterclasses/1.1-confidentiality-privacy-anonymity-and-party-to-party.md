* 💡 "If everyone owned their own identity...think of how much better data quality will be for companies."
* 🔒 Public key cryptography can be used to secure access at every level, making it efficient and effective for implementing secure systems.
* 💡 "If we want to build a wallet, then we should be doing it for a purpose... It is a digital token system that allows for the exchange of money, the exchange of value, the saving of records, and the tracking and transmission of information."
* 🗳️ Voting systems face challenges such as coercion, bribery, and the inclusion of deceased individuals, highlighting the need for provable identity and accountability in order to ensure fair and accurate elections.
* 💡 "If we have a global blockchain and people can prove records anywhere on Earth, imagine the complete evidence of every government seizure, every arrest, every everything else." - Craig Wright
* 💭 "What if you own your own data and your identity? So when we're talking about signing up for Twitter, then when we're doing our real identity, the attributes we put out there can be validated and the information could also be ours."
* 📧 "By storing messages on the blockchain, we can ensure the integrity of the messages and provide a secure and decentralized alternative to traditional email systems."

* 💡 By using a public key infrastructure (PKI) and Merkle trees, it is possible to selectively disclose only partial information while still proving one's identity, ensuring confidentiality in certain situations.
* 🕵️‍♂️ Traceability in Bitcoin and blockchain can make it difficult to find specific information in a planet full of haystacks, but it also enables lawfulness and the ability to prove transactions, making it challenging for criminals to get away with illegal activities.
