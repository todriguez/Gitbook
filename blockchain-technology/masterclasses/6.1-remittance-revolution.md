# 6.1 - Remittance Revolution

#### Innovation and Opportunities in Micropayment Systems

* 💰 The psychological barrier to micro payments is about a tenth of a cent, meaning that once the cost goes below that, people don't care about the fees anymore, even those who only have $2 a day.
* 💱 The use of atomic swaps and Central Bank digital currencies could allow individuals to have more control over their money, mitigating the impact of inflation and providing greater financial flexibility.
* 🌍 Integrating various features and functionalities into a cryptocurrency platform, such as language learning opportunities and logistics support, can help expand its reach and create a network effect for widespread adoption.
* 💡 The more trade and exchange that occurs, the more it builds up liquidity and creates new opportunities that people haven't thought of before.
* 💰 Lower transaction fees and the ability to transact in fractions of a second and cents could revolutionize how we interact and lead to the development of new industries and solutions.
* ⚡ The goal of scalability in Bitcoin is not just to be slightly better or incrementally improved, but to be cheaper and faster than anything in human history, with the aim of achieving trillions of transactions per second.
* 🌍 By opening up and allowing others to take their data and build on their ideas, the speaker believes that they can create a bigger pie and benefit more people, rather than focusing on owning everything and increasing their own percentage of the pie.
* 🌍 Empowering individuals through innovation and competition is more desirable than having a centralized community like Silicon Valley, as it allows for unpredictable and chaotic development that can lead to creative disruption and positive change.
* 💱 The potential of micropayment systems and increased liquidity through Bitcoin opens up opportunities for the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other forms of digital money.
* 💰 "If we can now open up the direct exchange of different people with money sending it back instantly, we change the very nature of how people interact in a good way."
* 🌍 Building an open platform for micropayments and embracing competition can drive innovation and address barriers in the remittance industry.

#### Empowerment and Financial Inclusion

* 💰 The empowerment of women is crucial for lifting families out of poverty and creating lasting change.
* 💰 Instead of simply handing out money to governments, the speaker proposes developing solutions that integrate technology, such as affordable phones and renewable energy sources, to empower individuals in poverty-stricken areas.
* 🌍 "Geography is no longer the world of physical constraints but choice, should I move my money between pounds or US dollars or pesos."
* 💡 Empowering the billions of people at the bottom of the world with high IQs and ideas can transform the world into something extraordinary.

#### Challenges in Global Remittance

* 💰 The biggest challenge in global remittance is the high cost, especially for those at the bottom of the income table who need to send money but can't afford the expensive fees.
* 💱 The ability to keep money in different currencies and choose how to pay can provide more flexibility and potentially lower fees compared to traditional remittance methods, such as stable coins or bank transfers.
* 💰 Micro payments can revolutionize the remittance industry by allowing individuals to send smaller amounts of money without high transaction costs or the need for traditional Forex trading platforms.
