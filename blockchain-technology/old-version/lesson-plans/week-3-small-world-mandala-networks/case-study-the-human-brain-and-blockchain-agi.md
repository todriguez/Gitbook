# Case Study: The Human Brain and Blockchain AGI

## The Human Brain as a Small World Network and the Potential for AGI on a Blockchain using MNCA



**Overview:** This case study delves into the human brain as an example of a small world network, exploring its structure and function in relation to cognition and consciousness. The study further investigates the potential of using blockchain technology, in conjunction with Multiple Neighborhood Cellular Automata (MNCA), to create an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). By understanding the human brain's small world network properties, we can draw insights and inspiration for developing AGI models and systems.

**The Human Brain as a Small World Network:** The human brain consists of interconnected neurons that form a complex network, exhibiting small world network characteristics such as high clustering and short average path lengths. These features allow for efficient information processing and transmission, leading to the emergence of properties such as consciousness, identity, and metacognition.

**Creating an AGI on a Blockchain using MNCA:** The proposed model for AGI development combines blockchain technology with MNCA. By placing MNCA on a blockchain with an interaction protocol and incentives, it is suggested that an AGI can be created, simulating the properties of cognition as an emergent phenomenon. This approach leverages the strengths of both blockchain and MNCA, drawing inspiration from the human brain's small world network properties to create a potential framework for AGI.
