# UTXO-Based DAG's Questions

1. How does the UTXO model contribute to the scalability and efficiency of DAGs built using the Bitcoin protocol?
2. What are the main differences between UTXO-based DAGs and account-based DAGs? How do these differences impact their respective use cases?
3. How does the parallelization of Merkle trees in UTXO-based systems enhance the performance of DAGs built on the Bitcoin protocol?
4. Can you explain the process of creating and managing multi-member authorities in UTXO-based DAGs? What are the benefits of using multi-member authorities for collaborative decision-making?
5. How do Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) and payment channels enhance the security and privacy of UTXO-based DAGs?
6. In the context of the supply chain management case study, how can UTXO-based DAGs help improve transparency, traceability, and efficiency?
7. Project Babbage have a tool called UTXO Dojo [https://dojo.babbage.systems/](https://dojo.babbage.systems/) what is unique about this application and how might it be used to help to build Bitcoin-enabled applications?
8. How can UTXO-based DAGs support the integration of digital agreements and other programmable features in the Bitcoin ecosystem?
9. Are there specific industries or sectors where UTXO-based DAGs could have a particularly significant impact? Why?
10. How do UTXO-based DAGs built on the Bitcoin protocol compare to other distributed ledger technologies, such as Ethereum or other blockchain platforms, in terms of scalability, security, and overall utility?

These questions will help students deepen their understanding of the relevancy and extreme utility of UTXO-based DAGs using the Bitcoin protocol. By addressing these questions, students will gain insights into the advantages, challenges, and potential applications of UTXO-based DAGs in various industries and contexts.
