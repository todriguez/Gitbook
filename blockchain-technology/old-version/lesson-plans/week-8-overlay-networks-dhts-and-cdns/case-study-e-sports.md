# Case Study: E-Sports

### I. Introduction

* The growing popularity of e-sports
* The current challenges faced by the industry (latency, fairness, monetization)

### II. The Problem

* Latency issues in online gaming and its impact on the esports experience
* Fairness concerns in the e-sports industry, such as cheating, match-fixing, and opaque player contracts
* Monetization challenges, including revenue generation and distribution for players, teams, and organizers
* Currently making money from e- sports is limited to only the most popular streamers and elite players, the top <0.1%, whereas the vast majority of gamers are often subjected to predatory and superficial monetisation models (pay to win, loot boxes, artifical scarcity of certain items et cetera) &#x20;

### III. The Solution: Value-based Internet

* Improved content delivery and reduced latency through the integration of CDNs and overlay networks with Bitcoin SV
* Micropayments as a new revenue model for players, teams, and organizers, enabled by the Bitcoin SV network
* Action Protocols and tokenization whereby players can carry their player identity and items across games and platforms
* BitcoinSV SDKs for Open Source Game Engines, giving independent game developers new ways to monetise and monetise assets (asset stores, item marketplaces et cetera)
* Enhanced fairness and transparency through blockchain-based systems (e.g., player contracts, match results, rewards distribution)

### IV. Examples of Esports Applications Leveraging the Value-based Internet

* Description of e-sports applications that have integrated the value-based internet approach
* Benefits gained by these applications, such as reduced latency, improved fairness, and new revenue models

### V. Conclusion

* The potential impact of a value-based internet on the e-sports industry in the Philippines and beyond
* Possible obstacles and challenges in implementing a value-based internet within the e-sports industry
