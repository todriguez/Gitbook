# Reading List

Here is a reading list to provide students with the necessary background knowledge to undertake the case study on P2P social media using IPv6 and the Bitcoin Protocol:

1. "An Introduction to IPv6" by Internet Society: [https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2011/an-introduction-to-ipv6/](https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2011/an-introduction-to-ipv6/)

This document provides a comprehensive introduction to IPv6, its features, and its benefits. It explains the need for IPv6, the expanded address space, and the advantages it offers over IPv4.

2. "Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) and CGA++: Methods and Security Analysis" by IETF Journal: [https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2012/10/cryptographically-generated-addresses-cga-and-cga-methods-and-security-analysis/](https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2012/10/cryptographically-generated-addresses-cga-and-cga-methods-and-security-analysis/)

This article delves into Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) and CGA++ methods, which can be used to generate IPv6 addresses using Bitcoin key pairs. The article provides an overview of the methods and discusses their security implications.

3. "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" by Satoshi Nakamoto: [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

This seminal paper by Satoshi Nakamoto introduces the Bitcoin Protocol as a decentralized electronic cash system. It provides the foundation for understanding the potential applications of the Bitcoin Protocol in various contexts, including decentralized social media.

4. [https://youtu.be/ynhxPCSBDRc](https://youtu.be/ynhxPCSBDRc)

Dr Craig S Wright, Chief Scientist at nChain, speaks about how Bitcoin SV can be integrated with IPv6 to deliver a new peer-to-peer model for the Internet.

By studying these resources, students should gain a solid understanding of the concepts and technologies involved in the case study on P2P social media using IPv6 and the Bitcoin Protocol. This reading list will prepare them to engage in discussions and group activities related to the case study, allowing them to explore the potential benefits and challenges of this innovative approach to social media.
