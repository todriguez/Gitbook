# Case Study Questions

Instead of providing the case study directly, the facilitator can present a series of questions to encourage students to think critically and develop their understanding of the UTXO-based PoW system and account-based PoS system through group discussions. Here are some questions that can be used:

1. What factors contributed to the failure of Cryptokitties as a dApp on the Ethereum network? How do these factors relate to the account-based model and the limitations of PoS systems?
2. Discuss the concerns raised by the SEC regarding the classification of Ethereum as a security. How might this classification impact the legal standing and potential adoption of Ethereum and its associated dApps?
3. How do the incentives for miners in a PoW system, such as Bitcoin, differ from the incentives for validators in a PoS system like Ethereum? How do these differences impact the security and performance of each network?
4. Considering the challenges faced by Cryptokitties and the SEC concerns surrounding Ethereum, what advantages might UTXO-based PoW systems offer over account-based PoS systems in terms of scalability, security, and legal standing?
5. Explore the potential implications of Ethereum's transition from PoW to PoS on its ability to support dApps and scale effectively. How might this transition affect existing dApps, such as Cryptokitties?
6. How does a developer group being able to unilaterally change the protocol expose it to concerns of it not in fact being a protocol?

By posing these questions, the facilitator encourages students to engage with the material, work together to develop their understanding, and ultimately arrive at the concepts presented in the case study through guided exploration and discussion.
