In this lesson, students will explore privacy features of the Bitcoin Protocol and the end-to-end model. The lesson will begin with an introduction to privacy, the difference between privacy and anonymity, and the importance of privacy in the context of the Bitcoin Protocol.

Students will learn about the privacy features of the Bitcoin Protocol, including not reusing keys, the abundance of keys, identity firewalled transactions, and the role of end-to-end authentication and encryption.

The lesson will then focus on the end-to-end model and its implications for privacy. Students will learn about Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), IPv6, and encrypted end-to-end communication. The lesson will also cover serverless pub-sub models between peers and their benefits for privacy.

Students will explore privacy through data ownership and control, including control over personal information via the Bitcoin Protocol, consensual sharing of data, and secondary markets for data sharing. The privacy benefits of the Bitcoin Protocol for businesses and users will also be discussed.

The case study will focus on a privacy-centric social media platform built with the Bitcoin Protocol. Students will learn about the challenges in maintaining privacy on traditional social media platforms and how the Bitcoin Protocol and the end-to-end model can address these challenges.

The lesson will conclude with a summary and an opportunity for students to ask questions and engage in discussion.
