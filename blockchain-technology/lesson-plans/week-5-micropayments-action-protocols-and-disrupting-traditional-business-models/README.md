# Week 5: Micropayments, Action Protocols and Disrupting Traditional Business Models

### I. Introduction (15 minutes)

* Overview of micropayments with the Bitcoin Protocol
* Over view of Action Protocols
* Impact on subscription and user data selling models&#x20;

### II. History and Importance of Micropayments (15 minutes)&#x20;

* Micropayments: the difference between 0.01c and 0c at scale with Metcalfe and Reid's Laws&#x20;
* Challenges faced by other micropayment solutions&#x20;
* The Bitcoin Protocol and its approach to micropayments&#x20;

### III. Scalability and Micropayments (15 minutes)&#x20;

* 1 billion transactions per second (tps) by 2030 at a thousandth of a cent&#x20;
* Opening new markets through micropayments&#x20;
* Data as the new oil and the role of micropayments in returning value to users&#x20;
* Size of the potential micropayments market

### &#x20;IV. Action Protocols (15 minutes)

* Project Babbage is leading the way in this paradigm
* Micropayments enable users to take actions, with those actions recorded immutably on chain, either directly on chain or on a second layer
* Users own all their own actions and therefore data
* Users can take their data with them between platforms, and anyone who wants to access their data must come to consensus with the user

### V. Impact on Traditional Business Models (15 minutes)&#x20;

* Legacy financial processors (PayPal and Visa)&#x20;
* Customer satisfaction with subscription models and social media services&#x20;
* Data leaks and privacy concerns&#x20;
* Knowledge is power: Empowering users through micropayments&#x20;
* Secondary markets for data and data integrity&#x20;

### VI. Case Study: Enabling Financial Inclusion through Micropayments (15 minutes)&#x20;

* Overview of financial inclusion challenges in the world&#x20;
* The potential of the Bitcoin Protocol's micropayments for enabling financial services access&#x20;
* Benefits for the unbanked population, businesses, and the overall economy&#x20;

### &#x20; VII. Summary and Q\&A (10 minutes)&#x20;

* Recap of key points covered in the lesson&#x20;
* Open the floor for questions and discussion&#x20;

In this lesson, students will learn about micropayments in Bitcoin SV and their potential to disrupt traditional business models. The lesson will start with an introduction to micropayments and their impact on subscription and user data selling models.&#x20;

Students will explore the history and importance of micropayments, challenges faced by other micropayment solutions, and Bitcoin SV's approach to micropayments. The lesson will then discuss scalability, the goal of reaching 1 billion transactions per second by 2030, and the new markets that can be opened through micropayments.&#x20;

The impact of micropayments on traditional business models will be examined, including legacy financial processors such as PayPal and Visa, customer satisfaction with subscription models and social media services, and data leaks and privacy concerns. Students will learn how micropayments empower users and the potential for secondary markets for data.&#x20;

"Micropayments: the difference between 0.01c and 0c at scale with Metcalfe and Reid's Laws" appears to indicate a focus on how minuscule payments, seemingly inconsequential at an individual level, can create considerable value when they're applied at a large scale within network systems.

To explain this further:

*   Metcalfe's Law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users. The classic example is a fax machine: if there's only one in the world, it's useless. However, with two fax machines, you can send and receive messages, and the value of each machine increases. Now, if there are a thousand fax machines, the potential connections and value increase exponentially.

    When applied to micropayments, even a tiny transaction, such as 0.01c, can gain significant value within a large network. If you have a network of 1,000,000 users, and each makes a micropayment of 0.01c, the aggregate value becomes $10,000. Therefore, the presence of micropayments in such a network increases the network's value significantly, even though individually each micropayment seems inconsequential.
*   Reid's Law extends Metcalfe's Law by considering the growth of social networks. It suggests that the value of a social network grows exponentially with the size of the network due to the potential for subgroup formation. Essentially, it's not just the direct connections (like in Metcalfe's law) but the different possible combinations of those connections in smaller groups that increase the network's value.

    For micropayments, this could mean that even more value can be derived as the network grows and more subgroup interactions occur. For example, consider an online platform where users can donate small amounts to content creators. As the platform grows, and more creators and donors join and form various subgroups based on interests, the total value circulating in micropayments could significantly increase.

Together, these laws can be interpreted to suggest a powerful implication of micropayments: while a micropayment might seem insignificant on its own, when implemented within a vast network, it can contribute to creating substantial value. This course section would therefore explain this crucial aspect of digital economics and the role of micropayments in online platforms and communities.

The case study will focus on enabling financial inclusion through micropayments. Students will learn about the financial inclusion challenges faced by previously excluded countries and how theBitcoin Protocol's micropayments can enable greater access to financial services. The benefits for the unbanked population, businesses, and the overall economy will be discussed.&#x20;

The lesson will conclude with a summary and an opportunity for students to ask questions and engage in discussion.&#x20;
