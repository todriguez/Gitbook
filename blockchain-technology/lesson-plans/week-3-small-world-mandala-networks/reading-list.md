This article explains the economic value of measuring accurate data, and particularly material risk and fact data into existence using block chain technology. Any AI must be able to trust its senses with trusted input from trusted sources, and as more menial knowledge work is automated by AI, human work will adapt to be more creative and innovative as well. Robles and Leyton explain how block chain technology can work to better measure engineering value and innovation.
