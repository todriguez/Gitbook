The LiteClient Toolbox is a suite of modular components designed to facilitate Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) in the Bitcoin network. SPV allows users to verify transactions without needing to run a full node or store the entire blockchain. Instead, users only need to store block headers, Merkle proofs, and the ability to check the state of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) with miners. This significantly reduces operational costs and resource requirements, as they scale with the user's business volume rather than the network volume as a whole.

The LiteClient Toolbox includes components such as the Wallet, Block Headers Client, Direct Payment Protocol (DPP) Proxy, Peer Channels, and Paymail Server. These components enable various functionalities, such as routing payment requests to a wallet not exposed to the internet, allowing wallets to go offline while waiting for their transactions to be included in a block, and migrating funds from external wallets.

The LiteClient Toolbox is designed to be modular, allowing users to choose and use the components that best fit their needs. It also provides a foundation for future enhancements and features, such as payment/state channels, multi-party payments, token/NFT transfers, and data certification verification.
