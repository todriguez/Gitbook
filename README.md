# Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive educational package designed to integrate blockchain technology, specifically the Bitcoin SV (BSV) protocol, into the curriculum of Ateneo de Manila University. The initiative aims to equip students with a robust understanding of blockchain's potential to transform various business sectors and society at large.

The program comprises two broad courses. The first introduces students to blockchain technology, focusing on cryptographic primitives, enterprise suitability, and protocol design basics. It also includes case studies that illustrate blockchain's potential for business, targeting both business leaders and technical engineers.

The second course delves into the technical aspects, presenting a best practice scalable system architecture for blockchain. It emphasizes the importance of technical standards for achieving interoperability, a key factor in unlocking blockchain technology's immense potential. This course also provides students with practical experience with mature platforms such as the Babbage SDK, sCrypt and its IDE, and the 1sat token protocol.

A key principle underlying this educational package is the standardization of both the system elements and the teaching methodology. This approach aims to avoid misconceptions and erroneous beliefs, preventing the misallocation of resources on pursuing dead ends that could be better deployed on functional systems.

Each course includes 12 lecture plans, each accompanied by a collection of resources and discussion questions. These resources include videos, academic articles, interviews, and technical protocol documentation. Links to all educational content from the BSV Academy are also provided.

Looking ahead, we anticipate future developments in blockchain education, such as the work of Project Babbage and a range of upcoming courses from the BSV Academy. These developments will further enrich our educational package and ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

Regarding assessment methodology, we propose group projects that allow for collaboration between different personality types. These projects would involve developing a wireframe, business plan, proposing technical standards, and an overall system architecture. However, the primary assessment would be based on individual reports on the merits of their group project and the issues that arose, along with proposed solutions based on their understanding. We plan to develop this formula towards the end of the faculty training program and remain open to continued dialogue and consultation on the development of such assessments.

In conclusion, this educational program aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding and leveraging the power of blockchain technology. We look forward to working closely with your faculty in rolling out this program and contributing to the advancement of blockchain education.
