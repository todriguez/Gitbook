The case study explores the potential of blockchain technology, specifically the Original Bitcoin Protocol (OBP), to improve supply chain visibility in the fish farming industry. The industry faces challenges related to cost, quality, and sustainability, with an increasing demand for transparency from consumers. The study found that blockchain technology could enhance visibility, improve operational efficiency, and secure the documentation of information. The use of blockchain, combined with other technologies like IoT devices, could automate information capture along the supply chain, which is mostly done manually today. The study also identified barriers to blockchain adoption, including a lack of knowledge and the need for industry-wide participation, regulations, and standards. The authors conclude that the fish farming industry should further explore the potential of blockchain technology, given its potential to revolutionize business operations.

Leading Questions:

1. How can blockchain technology, specifically the Original Bitcoin Protocol, improve supply chain visibility in the fish farming industry?
2. What are the current challenges faced by the fish farming industry, and how can blockchain technology address these challenges?
3. How can the combination of blockchain technology with other technologies like IoT devices benefit the fish farming industry?
4. What are the barriers to blockchain adoption in the fish farming industry, and how can they be overcome?
5. How does the use of blockchain technology align with the principles of triple-entry accounting discussed in Week 7 of the course?
6. How can the implementation of blockchain technology in the fish farming industry lead to improved financial transparency, reduced fraud, and streamlined auditing?
7. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing blockchain technology in the fish farming industry?
8. How can the lessons learned from this case study be applied to other industries considering the adoption of blockchain technology for improved supply chain visibility?

1. The thesis explores the application of blockchain technology for supply chain visibility, specifically in the context of the fish farming industry.
2. The authors identify two major features of blockchain: trust and decentralization, with three sub-characteristics within each. Decentralization means that in a blockchain transaction system, each transaction does not need to be validated through a central trusted agency. This implies that third parties, which result in higher costs and performance bottlenecks at the central servers, are no longer needed.
3. The authors discuss the current situation in the fish farming industry, including the importance of quality, price, and service. They also mention the rise in technological solutions for product tracking in the industry today, such as sensor technologies, RFID, cooling labels, GPS-based systems, track and trace systems, and cameras.
4. The thesis suggests that blockchain technology could potentially change the dynamics of supply chain visibility. One blockchain expert argued for the blockchain implementation in the fish farming industry, stating that there is too little transparency throughout the supply chain and significant complexity and inefficiencies in the industry.
5. The authors also discuss the challenges of implementing blockchain technology in supply chains, including the need for industries to develop standards that allow all systems to speak the same language.
6. The thesis concludes by suggesting that future research should look at how food supply chain visibility will become more important due to pressing demands from customers on sustainability.

Please note that this is a high-level summary and the document contains much more detailed information.
