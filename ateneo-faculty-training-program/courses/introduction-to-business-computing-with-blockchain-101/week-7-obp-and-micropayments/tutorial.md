**Tutorial Questions on the Readings (Neilson and Arthur):**

1. The Bitcoin whitepaper mentions the cost of mediation making small casual payments uneconomical. How do Neilson and Arthur's views align or contrast with this perspective?
2. The Original Bitcoin Protocol (BSV) emphasizes scalability. How does this scalability make BSV uniquely positioned to handle global micropayments compared to other blockchains?
3. Discuss the HTTP error code 402, reserved for "Payment Required." How does this relate to the concept of micropayments, and what implications does it have for the future of web transactions?
4. Arthur touches on the advertising model of the web. How could micropayments invert this model? What are the potential benefits and challenges of transitioning from an advertising-centric model to one with multiple microrevenue streams?
5. Given the readings, discuss the potential of the Original Bitcoin Protocol in addressing the challenges highlighted by both Neilson and Arthur. How does OBP's approach to micropayments differ from the visions presented in the readings?
6. Reflecting on both articles, which were written in 1998 and 2009 respectively, and considering the release of the Bitcoin blockchain in 2009, how do you think the narrative around Bitcoin as a "store of value" or "digital gold" has impacted the adoption and perception of its micropayment capabilities?
7. Given the timeframes of the articles and the evolution of blockchain technology, do you believe that the challenges associated with micropayments are primarily technological, economic, or cultural? Provide reasons for your answer.
