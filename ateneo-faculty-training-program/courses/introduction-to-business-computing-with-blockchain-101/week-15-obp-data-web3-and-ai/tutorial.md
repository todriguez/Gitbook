1. **User-Centric Internet in Web3**: The article describes Web3 as a "read-write-own" based user-centric internet. How does this align with the social impact goals of the Original Bitcoin Protocol (OBP)?
2. **Decentralization and Zero-Trust Architecture**: The article emphasizes the need for a zero-trust architecture in Web3. How can OBP contribute to establishing this kind of architecture?
3. **Identity Management and Decentralized Identifiers (DID)**: The article discusses the importance of identity management systems and DIDs. How can OBP, with its focus on data integrity and transparency, contribute to these aspects?
4. **Incentive Mechanisms**: The article talks about large-scale incentive mechanisms for the long-term sustainability of Web3. How does OBP's incentive structure align or contrast with this?
5. **Physical Infrastructure**: Web3 is built on physical infrastructure like communication, networking, storage, and computing. How can OBP contribute to establishing an effective and secure Web3 in these areas?
6. **AI and Blockchain in Web3**: One of the articles in the special issue discusses AI and Blockchain empowered Metaverse for Web 3.0. How can OBP, known for its scalability and data integrity, contribute to the integration of AI in Web3?
7. **Social and Economic Implications**: Given that Web3 aims not to allow power to rest with a few big internet companies, what are the potential social and economic implications? How can OBP contribute to a more equitable distribution of power?
8. **Future Research Directions**: The special issue highlights future research directions in Web3. What role do you see for OBP in shaping the future of Web3, especially in the context of social impact?
9. **Explainable AI and Data Provenance**: How can the principles of explainable AI and data provenance be integrated into the Web3 architecture? Can OBP play a role in ensuring data provenance in large generative models?
10. **Cultural, Technological, or Economic Challenges**: Given the timeframes of the articles and the evolution of blockchain technology, do you believe that the challenges associated with Web3 are primarily technological, economic, or cultural? Provide reasons for your answer.
