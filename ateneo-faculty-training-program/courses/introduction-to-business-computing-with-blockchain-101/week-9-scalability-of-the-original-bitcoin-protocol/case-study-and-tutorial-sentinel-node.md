If a hack goes beyond 30 days, the average cost for an enterprise is almost 9 million dollars, highlighting the urgent need for real-time cyber breach detection solutions like Sentinel Node. By lowering the cost and providing real-time detection, Sentinel Node brings a profound change in the way attacks and hacks are detected, making it more accessible for businesses to have a mission-critical log detection system. A hacker can potentially remain undetected in a system for a long time, as businesses often have a delayed notification period of 30 to 90 days or even just five hours.

By utilizing the capabilities of the Bitcoin SV blockchain, Sentinel Node enables cost-effective and scalable real-time cyber breach detection, reducing the window of opportunity for breaches to occur. The Sentinel Node system allows users to monitor and track the health of their devices and files in real-time, providing a proactive approach to cyber breach detection.The hash chain is reset and restored when a breach occurs and is resolved, ensuring the integrity of the monitored files.

Based on this summary, here are some leading questions for the case study discussion:

1. How does the Sentinel Node's use of the Original Bitcoin Protocol (OBP) contribute to its scalability and real-time detection capabilities?
2. What are the business implications of Sentinel Node's real-time cyber breach detection system? How does it impact cost, risk management, and operational efficiency?
3. How does the Sentinel Node case study illustrate the unique features of OBP compared to other blockchain technologies?
4. How does the Sentinel Node system align with the regulatory landscape surrounding blockchain technologies?
5. How can the Sentinel Node system be applied to other business processes and operations beyond cyber breach detection?
6. What are the societal implications of integrating a system like Sentinel Node, powered by OBP, into business processes?
