* How does Grigg describe the evolution of identity from tribal communities to state-issued identities?
* Discuss the concept of "belongership" as presented by Grigg. How does it challenge traditional views of identity?
* Reflect on the role of trust in Grigg's perspective on identity. How does blockchain technology align with his views on trust and community-driven identity?
* Grigg emphasizes the chama as a bastion of trust and identity. How might blockchain platforms, like OBP, facilitate or enhance such community-based identity systems?
* In Grigg's work, he critiques the reduction of identity to mere numbers (e.g., social credit scores). How can blockchain technology offer a more holistic approach to identity?
* Drawing from Grigg's insights, discuss the potential challenges and benefits of implementing a blockchain-based identity system that emphasizes community and trust.
* Reflect on the relationship between identity, trust, and community as presented by Grigg. How do these concepts intersect, and what implications do they have for the future of digital identity on blockchain platforms?
