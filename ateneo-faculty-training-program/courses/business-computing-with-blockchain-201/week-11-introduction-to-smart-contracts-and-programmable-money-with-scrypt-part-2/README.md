# Week 11: Introduction to Smart Contracts & Programmable Money with sCrypt - Part 2

Lecture Plan:

1. Introduction (5 minutes)
   * Recap of previous lectures and introduction to the week's topic
   * Importance of advanced topics in sCrypt and hands-on exercises
2. Advanced Topics in sCrypt (15 minutes)
   * Discuss the implementation of Tap Root on BTC and how it can be done in sCrypt
   * Discuss the potential of Bitcoin smart contracts to enable various applications, including Zero Knowledge Proof enabled computation, Outsourcing, Dark Forest type hidden information games, and AI machine learning with preserved privacy
   * Discuss the privacy and anonymity in smart contracts, including the stateless nature of Bitcoin smart contracts and the use of advanced cryptography such as zero knowledge proofs
3. Hands-on Exercises and Problem-Solving with sCrypt (20 minutes)
   * Walkthrough of a hands-on exercise building a zk-snark contract and a stateful voting contract
   * Discuss how sCrypt uses a concept called scriptContext as its nomenclature for OP-PUSH-TX and referencing the tx preimage
   * Discuss the potential issues and solutions that may arise during the implementation of these contracts
4. Introduction to the scryptTS Framework (15 minutes)
   * Provide an overview of the scryptTS framework and its main features
   * Discuss the advantages of developing smart contracts in TypeScript using the scryptTS framework
   * Discuss the upcoming tutorials on scryptTS and what they are expected to cover
5. Discussion and Q\&A (5 minutes)
   * Open the floor for questions and discussion on the lecture's content
   * Clarify any doubts and provide additional information as needed
