Using the tools from the Project Babbage system (Metanet Client and Babbage SDK) create your first bitcoin transaction.

To see what's really happening under the hood, examine the following video of a transaction being built from scratch on the RegTest network.

The above repository is for a tool that allows a user to create a dockerised regtest stack and then interface with it through a webform and a golang back end. This allows the user to generate key pairs, mine blocks against those keys, and then create transactions from scratch that spend the coinbase block reward of the mined blocks.&#x20;
