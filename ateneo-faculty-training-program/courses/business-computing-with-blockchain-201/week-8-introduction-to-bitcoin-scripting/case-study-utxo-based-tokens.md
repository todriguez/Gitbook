**Tutorial Plan for Week 8: Introduction to Bitcoin Scripting and UTXO-based Tokens**

1. **Introduction to BRC-48: Pay to Push Drop (15 minutes)**
   * Discuss the abstract and motivation behind BRC-48.
   * Explain the concept of pushing arbitrary data onto the stack and dropping it with OP\_DROP or OP\_2DROP.
   * Discuss the importance of a simple P2PK lock with a public key and OP\_CHECKSIG for enabling ownership transfer.
   * Discuss the concept of representing tokens as UTXOs and how it improves scalability.
2. **Hands-on Exercise: Implementing BRC-48 (30 minutes)**
   * Guide students through the process of creating a token using the BRC-48 standard.
   * Discuss the PushDrop JavaScript library and how it implements the BRC-48 standard.
   * Have students create their own tokens using the BRC-48 standard.
3. **Introduction to BRC-45: Definition of UTXOs as Bitcoin Tokens (15 minutes)**
   * Discuss the abstract and background of BRC-45.
   * Explain the concept of UTXOs as the central framework of tokenization in Bitcoin.
   * Discuss the benefits of UTXOs as the fundamental unit of tokenization, including decentralization, scalability, double-spend protection, and simplified verification.
4. **Introduction to BRC-59: Security and Scalability Benefits of UTXO-based Overlay Networks (15 minutes)**
   * Discuss the abstract and motivation behind BRC-59.
   * Explain the concept of UTXO-based overlay networks and their advantages.
   * Discuss the importance of miners in preventing double-spends and keeping clients in sync with the rest of the network.
5. **Discussion and Q\&A (15 minutes)**
   * Open the floor for questions and discussion on the lecture's content.
   * Clarify any doubts and provide additional information as needed.
