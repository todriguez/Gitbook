**Bitcoin is a Commodity** - [https://craigwright.net/blog/economics/bitcoin-is-a-commodity/](https://craigwright.net/blog/economics/bitcoin-is-a-commodity/)\
Craig Wright argues that Bitcoin is not a new form of money, but rather a commodity, with the value lying in its immutable ledger and computational capability. Bitcoin is not legal tender and hence is either a commodity or a Ponzi scheme. According to the definition of money given in the legal case Travelex Limited v Commissioner of Taxation \[2008] FCA 1961 (Travelex), Bitcoin could be considered "money" due to its use as a generally accepted medium of exchange and its negotiable quality, despite not being a government-issued currency or legal tender.

<summary><strong>Week 8 - Regulatory Compliance and Blockchain Technologies</strong></summary>

* Case Study: BSV based smart legal contract for voluntary carbon credits under ISDA definitions: This case study will help you understand how the Original Bitcoin Protocol can be used to facilitate regulatory compliance.
* The Big Short Movie Clip ISDA pitch - [https://youtu.be/rN7BmmXfUiU](https://youtu.be/rN7BmmXfUiU)\
  This video illustrates the exclusivity of the futures and derivatives market and how it keeps little players out of the game. These ISDA licenses are supposed to ensure only the most proficient players are involved in the market but in actual fact it just ensured that the little players couldn't equalise an inefficiency in the market.&#x20;
* Interview with Richard Baker of Tokenovate - [https://youtu.be/Pwhz0cGt3G0](https://youtu.be/Pwhz0cGt3G0)
* Spotlight Panel Discussion with Richard Baker, Head of ISDA and GMEX -[https://youtu.be/AuvJSbG5zV8](https://youtu.be/AuvJSbG5zV8)
*   Tokenovate has executed of one of the world's first fully legal derivative smart contracts on the BSV blockchain, carried out by a joint venture of Tokenovate and GMEX.

    The smart contract pertains to voluntary carbon credits, an emerging market where corporations can buy credits from carbon projects like wind farms, solar panel farms, or carbon sinks like tropical forests or hemp farms.

    The voluntary carbon market is expected to grow from a billion-dollar market today to a 50 billion dollar market by 2030. However, the market currently suffers from issues like double counting and greenwashing, where fake credits are created.

    The smart contract executed on the BSV blockchain helps address these issues by providing transparency and traceability. It uses the Bitcoin script and the underlying opcodes to create a programmable template that manages the lifecycle of the trade.

    The smart contract is semi-autonomous, meaning it can respond to changes agreed upon by the two counterparties. It can also handle different types of trades, like spot trades and forward trades.

    The smart contract execution is fully legal because it follows the standards set by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), a global standards body recognized by global regulators. The smart contract also operates under the rulebook of a regulated market.

<summary><strong>Week 9 - Scalability of the Original Bitcoin Protocol</strong></summary>

* **Case Study - Sentinel Node:** This case study will provide you with a real-world example of how the Original Bitcoin Protocol can be scaled.
*   **Real Time Cyber Breach Detection via BSV -** [https://youtu.be/\_3VF07s9w4A](https://youtu.be/\_3VF07s9w4A)\
    If a hack goes beyond 30 days, the average cost for an enterprise is almost 9 million dollars, highlighting the urgent need for real-time cyber breach detection solutions like Sentinel Node. By lowering the cost and providing real-time detection, Sentinel Node brings a profound change in the way attacks and hacks are detected, making it more accessible for businesses to have a mission-critical log detection system. A hacker can potentially remain undetected in a system for a long time, as businesses often have a delayed notification period of 30 to 90 days or even just five hours.

    By utilizing the capabilities of the Bitcoin SV blockchain, Sentinel Node enables cost-effective and scalable real-time cyber breach detection, reducing the window of opportunity for breaches to occur. The Sentinel Node system allows users to monitor and track the health of their devices and files in real-time, providing a proactive approach to cyber breach detection.The hash chain is reset and restored when a breach occurs and is resolved, ensuring the integrity of the monitored files.

<summary><strong>Week 10 - The 'Set-in-Stone' Protocol of the Original Bitcoin Protocol</strong></summary>

* Case Study: Examination of how changes to the signature scheme can place modified protocols in violation of the Banking Secrecy Act: This case study will help you understand the implications of modifying the Original Bitcoin Protocol.
* Schnorr - [https://craigwright.net/blog/bitcoin-blockchain-tech/schnorr/](https://craigwright.net/blog/bitcoin-blockchain-tech/schnorr/)\
  The article discusses the implications of protocol variations on the legal standing of a blockchain, specifically Bitcoin. It emphasizes the difference between privacy and anonymity, arguing that Bitcoin was designed to be a private but not anonymous system. The author argues that anonymous systems are not legally enforceable and are prone to misuse, as seen in the Silk Road case. The article also discusses the introduction of Schnorr signatures, which some believe can provide plausible deniability and additional anonymity. However, the author argues that this is a misunderstanding and that such changes could lead to legal issues, including violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. The article concludes by stating that Bitcoin's protocol should remain immutable and that attempts to alter it for anonymity purposes will only lead to legal complications and potential failure.

*   "The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime. Because of that, I wanted to design it to support every possible transaction type I could think of. The problem was, each thing required special support code and data fields whether it was used or not, and only covered one special case at a time. It would have been an explosion of special cases. The solution was script, which generalizes the problem so transacting parties can describe their transaction as a predicate that the node network evaluates. The nodes only need to understand the transaction to the extent of evaluating whether the sender's conditions are met.

    The script is actually a predicate. It's just an equation that evaluates to true or false. Predicate is a long and unfamiliar word so I called it script.

    The receiver of a payment does a template match on the script. Currently, receivers only accept two templates: direct payment and bitcoin address. Future versions can add templates for more transaction types and nodes running that version or higher will be able to receive them. All versions of nodes in the network can verify and process any new transactions into blocks, even though they may not know how to read them.

    The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago. Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc. If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we'll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later.

    I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network. The MIT license is compatible with all other licenses and commercial uses, so there is no need to rewrite it from a licensing standpoint." - Satoshi Nakamoto, [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195.msg1617#msg1617](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195.msg1617#msg1617)[\
