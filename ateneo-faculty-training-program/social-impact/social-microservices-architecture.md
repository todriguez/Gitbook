# Social Microservices Architecture

Bitcoin is first and foremost a Data Check Valve, whereby the data on the Bitcoin database can only be changed forward in time. Satoshis pay the fees to update the ledger, and represent a minimum cost limit to open and close peer to peer parallel payment channels.

Accounting for value that cannot currently be accounted for. Bitcoin can power enterprise grade microservices for individuals and SMEs for the purpose of both payments and and data intregity.

Bitcoin can act as the substrate of for radically improving agency for entrepreneurs and individuals to shape and take part in a new vision of the future, putting self-responsibility and resilience first. While global financial capitalism has been good at raising wages and standards of living, it has not been good at spreading growth equitably and dealing with problems of moral hazard and material risk in markets. Planet Earth, for example, currently deals with $3 trillion of waste disposal for mankind every year for free. Supply chains are long and obfuscated, and global economic trends cause nations' economies to become over-specialised, leading to fragility and unhealthy co-dependencies to arise.

Social Microservices are micropayment plumbing and data integrity quality assurance at scale, increasing the breadth of accounting of cybernetic value across society, from the most disadvantaged people to the smallest IoT device. This allows us to measure more value into existence, closer to home.

A social microservices architecture refers to a decentralized and modular approach to building and delivering social services using blockchain technology, specifically the original Bitcoin Protocol. This concept involves breaking down social services into smaller, independent components (microservices) that can be developed, deployed, and maintained separately but work together seamlessly through well-defined interfaces and communication protocols.

A social microservices architecture built with the Bitcoin Protocol can bring various benefits to developing nations, including:

1. An ecosystem of modular components: By breaking down complex social services into smaller, manageable components, governments and organizations can streamline their processes, reduce redundancies, and enhance overall efficiency through an ecosystem model.
2. Scalability: Microservices can be individually scaled to meet the growing demand for specific services without affecting the performance of the entire system.
3. Flexibility: The modular nature of microservices enables governments and organizations to quickly adapt to changing needs and requirements by adding, updating, or removing individual components without disrupting the entire system.
4. Interoperability: Microservices can be designed to interact with other systems and services, promoting seamless data exchange and collaboration between different agencies, organizations, and sectors.
5. Security and privacy: Leveraging the inherent security and privacy features of the Bitcoin Protocol a social microservices architecture can help protect sensitive user data and ensure the integrity of transactions and records.
6. Inclusivity: A social microservices architecture built on blockchain technology can help bridge the digital divide and promote financial inclusion by enabling access to essential services for unbanked and underbanked populations.

The Bitcoin Protocol's ability to facilitate micropayments and its compatibility with an end-to-end IPv6:Bitcoin model has the potential to revolutionize the way that microservices architecture is implemented, which much greater economic breadth across society. This transformative approach can lead to the development of innovative services, applications, and business models that empower individuals, communities, and organizations.

1. Micropayments: Micropayments through the protocol enable the possibility of carrying out extremely low-cost transactions, opening up new opportunities for various industries and sectors. By eliminating the barriers associated with traditional payment systems, such as high transaction fees or minimum thresholds. The difference between 0.01 cents and 0 cents at scale, across billions of devices and people globally is enormous, especially given Metcalfe (parabolic) and Reid (exponential) value scaling laws. Bitcoin micropayments open a door to new possible $billion businesses in $trillion markets for which there is currently no way to measure this value into existence.
2. Data Integrity: Data on the Bitcoin ledger can only be changed forward in time. There is no update and delete on the Bitcoin ledger, only create and read. This means that there is no 'Memory Hole' on the Bitcoin ledger, which allows for better tracking and tracing of information pertaining to material risks (Insurance Technology) and material facts (Engineering Technology).

For example, the competence and trust for knowledge work, education and continuous professional development can be owned by professionals directly, improving trust while reducing costs and labor market friction. The provenance of digital signatures and identities can be managed with much greater fidelity with direct accountability.  Similarly, IoT devices can leverage micropayments for pay-per-use models or to transact with other devices in real-time, automating services and reducing overhead costs, creating new business models in manufacturing, robotics, automation, smart cities and more.

2. End-to-End IPv6:Bitcoin Model: The end-to-end IPv6:Bitcoin model facilitates seamless communication between devices, services, and applications built using the Bitcoin network. By using unique IPv6 addresses generated with Bitcoin key pairs and the robust security features of the protocol, this model enables direct, peer-to-peer interactions, enhancing privacy and reducing reliance on intermediaries.

This model can be particularly beneficial for developing a microservices architecture in society, as it allows for efficient and secure data exchange between various components of a system. For example, in a future city scenario, an end-to-end IPv6:Bitcoin model could enable real-time communication between transportation systems, energy grids, and waste management services, resulting in a more efficient and responsive urban environment.

The combination of micropayments and the end-to-end IPv6:Bitcoin model allows for the creation of a dynamic, decentralized microservices architecture in society. By enabling secure, low-cost transactions and direct communication between devices and services, this innovative approach can lead to the development of new applications and business models that promote economic growth, social impact, and overall well-being.

Some potential use cases of this model include:

* Peer-to-peer energy trading, where households with solar panels can sell excess energy directly to their neighbors, fostering the growth of renewable energy sources and reducing reliance on centralized grids.
* P2P social and professional networks that reward users for their content and contributions, fostering a more equitable and user-centric online ecosystems, where high value knowledge work and creative work can be properly valued and trusted.
* Crowdfunding platforms that allow individuals to support local projects, initiatives, or businesses with minimal fees, promoting entrepreneurship and community development.

Overall, the integration of micropayments and the end-to-end IPv6:Bitcoin model can enable a new generation of microservices architecture in society, unlocking immense potential for innovation, economic growth, and social impact.
