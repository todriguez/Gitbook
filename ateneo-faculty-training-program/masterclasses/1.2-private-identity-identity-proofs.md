# 1.2 Private Identity, Identity Proofs

#### Technology and Adoption

* 💡 The change in data ownership and control is more likely to come from the private sector rather than government legislation, as historically corporations have played a significant role in shaping societies.
* 🤔 "Bitcoin may be technologically superior, but its success depends on the economics and the economically viable solution."
* 💭 "So people don't move to from the technology that's slightly better they move through the 10 times better and if you're 10 times cheaper 10 times faster 10 times XYZ people move." - Craig Wright emphasizes the importance of being significantly better in terms of cost, speed, and efficiency in order to drive adoption and migration to a new technology like Bitcoin.
* 💭 Blockchain has the potential to make crime more expensive and less prevalent by recording everything securely and retrospectively, making it easier to catch and deter criminals.
* 💡 "Not having a world government is a good thing" - Craig Wright highlights the benefits of not having a global governing body.
* 💡 Craig Wright emphasizes the need for standardization in the IoT industry, stating that if no one takes the initiative to create a standard, it won't happen and government intervention should not be expected.
* 🌐 He explains that the UTXO model used in Bitcoin allows for independent validation of each transaction, making it suitable for parallelization and scalability, unlike account-based models.

#### Identity and Privacy

* 🏛️ The absence of limited liability in DAOs exposes individuals to potential legal risks and liabilities, highlighting the importance of corporate structures like corporations.
* 💼 The introduction of corporate controls allowed minority shareholders to take action against the interests of the majority, as seen in the case of the Buick brothers suing Ford for wasting shareholder money on moral issues.
* 💡 The concept of multiple digital identities can allow individuals to start fresh without losing their entire history, similar to the idea of a Jubilee in Judaism.
* 💭 "If we have that as our identity attribute then how many different identities can we have at once? One." - Craig Wright raises the question of how many different identities can be linked to a single identity attribute, highlighting the need for a clear and singular identity.
* 💡 "If I want to prove that I'm an accredited investor to get access to a prospectus. But I don't want the company knowing who I am can that happen. The company legally doesn't need to know who you are." - Craig Wright highlights the possibility of proving identity without revealing personal information, challenging the traditional notion of identity verification.
* 🐄 "Let's think about this for a moment. Even pets. People put a chip in, right? You now control that and there's information about that animal. Now, if you do the same in a cow and you now have that information, that chip stores what it is, where it's been bred, how it's been brought up, whether there's problems at the farm, all sorts of funky things."
