# Case Study: UTXO-Based DAG for Supply Chain Management in the Philippines:

### Introduction (5 minutes):

* Brief overview of the case study's objective
* The importance of supply chain management in the Philippines
* Introducing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and their relevance to UTXO-based systems

### Part 1: Setting Up the Environment (5 minutes):

* Guide students through the process of setting up the DAGDA library
* Registering with DAGDA and obtaining user ID and token
* Installing and initializing the DagdaClient

### Part 2: Creating Authorities and Nodes (10 minutes):

* Demonstrating the creation of an authority
* Creating a root node for a supply chain management system
* Adding child nodes to represent various stages of the supply chain, such as production, transportation, and distribution

### Part 3: Establishing Multi-Member Authorities for Collaborative Decision Making (5 minutes):

* Setting up a multi-member authority for joint decision-making between multiple parties
* Creating a root node for the multi-member authority
* Proposing and signing nodes within the multi-member authority

### Part 4: Exploring and Analyzing the DAG (5 minutes):

* Using the Dagda viewer to explore the created nodes and their relationships
* Discussing the benefits of using a UTXO-based DAG in the context of supply chain management, such as transparency, immutability, and efficiency

### Conclusion (1 minute):

* Recap of the case study and the importance of UTXO-based DAGs for supply chain management in the Philippines
* Encouraging students to think of other potential use cases for UTXO-based DAGs in the Philippines

This 30-minute case study will guide students through the process of creating a meaningful UTXO-based DAG using the DAGDA library for supply chain management in the Philippines. Students will learn how to set up the environment, create authorities and nodes, establish multi-member authorities for collaborative decision-making, and explore the resulting DAG. By the end of the case study, students will have a deeper understanding of the advantages and potential applications of UTXO-based DAGs in the context of the Philippines.
