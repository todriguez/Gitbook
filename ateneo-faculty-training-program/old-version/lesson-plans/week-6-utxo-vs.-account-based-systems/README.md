In this lesson, students will learn about the advantages of UTXO-based systems and how they compare to account-based models. The lesson will start with an introduction to UTXO-based systems and their comparison with account-based models.&#x20;

Students will explore the features of UTXO-based systems, including the parallelization of Merkle trees, transaction validation and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV), payment channels, and privacy features. The advantages of UTXO-based systems will be discussed.&#x20;

The lesson will then cover account-based systems, focusing on the knapsack problem and scalability challenges, as well as privacy concerns. The disadvantages of account-based systems will be examined.&#x20;

A comparison of UTXO and account-based systems will be made, addressing scalability, privacy, security, flexibility, and ease of use for developers. The implications for businesses and users will also be discussed.&#x20;

The case study will focus on UTXO-based spendable tokens and rights access management in the Philippines. Students will learn about the implementation and potential use cases in the country, as well as the benefits for businesses and users.&#x20;

The lesson will conclude with a summary and an opportunity for students to ask questions and engage in discussion.&#x20;
