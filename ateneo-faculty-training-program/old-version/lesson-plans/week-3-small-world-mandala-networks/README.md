### V. Detailed Case Study: The Human Brain as a Small World Network (15 minutes)

The human brain is a complex network of interconnected neurons, which can be viewed as a small world network. Small world networks are characterized by high clustering and short average path lengths, allowing for efficient information processing and transmission. The human brain's structure facilitates fast signal propagation and the emergence of properties such as consciousness and identity.

The paper by Sgantzos and Grigg proposes the use of blockchain technology and Multiple Neighbourhood Cellular Automata to create an Artificial General Intelligence. By placing MNCA on a blockchain with an interaction protocol and incentives, the authors suggest that an AGI can be developed, simulating the properties of cognition as an emergent phenomenon.

### VI. Summary and Q\&A (10 minutes)

* Recap of key points covered in the lesson&#x20;
* Open the floor for questions and discussion

In this lesson, students will explore the small world mandala network and its emergence in Bitcoin SV. The lesson will begin with an introduction to small world networks, their principles, and examples in different fields. Students will learn about the relationship between small world networks and other network topologies.

The emergence of the small world mandala network in Bitcoin SV will be discussed, including the incentive mechanisms that lead to its formation, the importance of node location and interconnectivity, and the interaction between different rings of the network.

Students will learn about the performance and efficiency of distributed systems, focusing on how the small world mandala network enhances performance in Bitcoin SV. Examples of blockchain applications leveraging the small world network will be provided.

The case study will explore the Small World Mandala Network of the Human Brain and the potential for developing AGI through neural networks and the blockchain.

The lesson will conclude with a summary and an opportunity for students to ask questions and engage in discussion.
