In this lesson, students will explore the synergy between the Bitcoin Protocol and IPv6, starting with an introduction to IPv6 and its role in addressing challenges faced by the Internet. The lesson will discuss the limitations of existing micropayment solutions and how the Bitcoin Protocol and IPv6 integration can offer improved performance, privacy, and a serverless model.

The lesson will also cover the process of generating IPv6 addresses using Bitcoin key pairs and CGA++, as well as the role of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Students will learn about the authenticated end-to-end paradigm, multicast groups, and Bitcoin-wrapped SRv6.

The performance and benefits of the end-to-end IPv6 and the Bitcoin Protocol model will be discussed, along with potential applications across various industries. The lesson will conclude with a summary and an opportunity for students to ask questions and engage in discussion.
