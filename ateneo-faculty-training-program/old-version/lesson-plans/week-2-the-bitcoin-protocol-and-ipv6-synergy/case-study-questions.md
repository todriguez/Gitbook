# Case Study Questions

Instead of providing the case study explicitly, the instructor can present a series of leading questions to encourage students to think critically and develop their understanding of the P2P social media model through group discussions. Here are some questions that can be used:

1. What are the main challenges and limitations of traditional, centralized professional social networking, remote working and outsourcing platforms regarding privacy, data control, reputation management and revenue models?
2. How can the end-to-end model enabled by the Bitcoin Protocol and IPv6 integration address these challenges and limitations?
3. In what ways can multicast groups contribute to a more personalized and user-centric professional social networking experience? How would you envision the creation and management of these groups?
4. Discuss the role of micropayments in this P2P professional social networking and outsourcing model. How can they incentivize the creation of quality content, of trusted reputations and connections and provide a better user experience by growing with users, rather than at their expense?
5. How can P2P content distribution empower users and promote a more equitable digital ecosystem? What challenges might arise in implementing such a system?
6. In your group, brainstorm potential features or tools that a P2P professional social media, outsourcing platform or remote working tools that Bitcoin could enable and discuss how the features of these might work within the context of the Bitcoin Protocol and IPv6 integration.

By posing these questions, the instructor encourages students to engage with the material, work together to develop their understanding, and ultimately arrive at the concepts presented in the case study through guided exploration and discussion.
