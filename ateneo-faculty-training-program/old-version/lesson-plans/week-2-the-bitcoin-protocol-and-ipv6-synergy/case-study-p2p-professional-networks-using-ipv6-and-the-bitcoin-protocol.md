# Case Study: P2P Professional Networks Using IPv6 and the Bitcoin Protocol

**Overview:** This case study explores the potential for creating a decentralized professional employment platform using the synergy between the Bitcoin Protocol and IPv6. It demonstrates the elimination of data silos present in traditional Web2 servers, and showcases an example of a new paradigm for knowledge work and professional networks on the internet. In this model, users can own their own professional reputation and carry their professional credentials and their professional profile across multiple platforms. Users can create multicast groups in order to work in teams, publish content to their peers, and receive content from others in a customized feed that rewards quality content through micropayments for quality job postings. Bitcoin enabled applications can then aid in forming trust in the recruitment process, digital signatures can be used to corroborate references and identities, distributed applications, escrow and third party arbitration can provide more trust for project delivery based payments and for arranging employment contracts. Bitcon can also enable the digital tools used to deliver work and the version control and authentication of that work.

**The Problem with Traditional Outsourcing Platforms and Professional Networking:** Traditional outsourcing and professional platforms rely on centralized servers that store user data, creating data silos which not only raises concerns about privacy, censorship, and control, but also means that professionals struggle to carry their reputations with them and retain a comprehensive record of recommendations, references, attestations and so forth. Additionally, these platforms often rely on advertising revenue, and users themselves are not necessarily primary customers which can lead to a poor user experience and questionable content promotion practices.

**P2P Professional Networking Solution:** Using the end-to-end model made possible by the integration of the Bitcoin Protocol and IPv6, a user can create various multicast groups with their peers. Using a microservices architecture for payments and distributed applications and data, users to buy and sell their time, skills, competence and advice with lower friction, greater trust and more ease.&#x20;

**Key Components:**

1. End-to-end model: Ensures privacy and performance by allowing direct communication between users without intermediaries.
2. Multicast groups: Facilitate the creation of diverse and customizable professional networks and working teams, providing a more personalized user experience.
3. Micropayments: Incentivize the creation of quality content pertaining to the sharing of more salient information pertaining to users as producers, not users as consumers or even users as product, as happens on current Siren Server platforms.
4. P2P content distribution: Enables users to maintain control of their data, eliminating data silos and promoting a more equitable digital ecosystem, where users own their professional reputations and identities and there is no 'Memory Hole' or Orwellian 'Ministry of Truth'.

**Conclusion:** This case study demonstrates the potential for a decentralized social media platform using the synergy between the Bitcoin Protocol and IPv6. By leveraging the end-to-end model, multicast groups, and micropayments, users can enjoy a more private, personalized, and equitable professional networking and remote working experience. This innovative approach has the potential to disrupt the traditional labour market landscape and pave the way for an end-to-end human-centric Industry 4.0 vision.
