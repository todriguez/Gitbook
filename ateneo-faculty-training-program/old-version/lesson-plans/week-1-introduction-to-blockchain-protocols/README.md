### Summary

The learning objectives for this lesson plan are to provide students with an understanding of blockchain technology, introduce the differences between UTXO and account-based models, and explore the advantages of the Bitcoin Protocol as a superior and scalable blockchain solution. The lesson will begin with an introduction to blockchain technology, discussing its definition, purpose, and various protocols.

Next, the lesson will briefly introduce the concepts of UTXO and account-based models and their differences, with more in-depth coverage planned for Week 6. Following this, the focus will shift to the Bitcoin Protocol as a superior and scalable blockchain solution.

The lesson will then delve into the comparison of Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, discussing their security, energy consumption, decentralization, legal implications, and the rich get richer issue in PoS systems. Afterward, the lesson will cover the set in stone protocol and legal standing of Bitcoin.

The case study on the comparative analysis of UTXO-based PoW and account-based PoS systems will be incorporated to demonstrate the advantages and potential drawbacks of each system, providing real-world context for the concepts discussed.

Finally, the lesson will conclude with a recap and summary of the key takeaways, followed by a Q\&A session and open discussion to address any remaining questions and facilitate deeper understanding.
